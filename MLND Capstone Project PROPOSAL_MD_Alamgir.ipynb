It should be clear how or why a problem in the domain can or should be solved. Related academic research should be appropriately cited. A discussion of the student's personal motivation for investigating a particular problem in the domain is encouraged but not required.]\n",

The objectives of these measurements are to diagnose the level of Dementia in the individuals and the probability that these individuals may have Alzheimer's Disease (AD).\n",

    "Recently, a close relative of mine had to undergo a sequence of MRI tests for cognition difficulties.The motivation for choosing this topic for the Capstone project arose from the desire to understand and analyze potential for Dementia and AD from MRI related data. This Capstone project does not use the MRI \"imaging\" data and does not focus on AD, focusses only on Dementia. \n"

    "\n",
    "* Cross-Sectional and longitudinal OASIS MRI structural and demographic data (clinical, demographic, and brain related derived anatomic measures) from human MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) tests (http://www.oasis-brains.org/) will be used to train a set of linear and non-linear machine learning classification models.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) values provided in the data set will be used as \"labels\" for training the classification models. [Clinical Dementia Ratings (CDR values:  0=nondemented; 0.5 – very mild dementia; 1 = mild dementia; 2 = moderate dementia)]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Pandas will be used for data loading and Python scikit-learn library for modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* The goal is to train machine learning models to predict whether the individuals in the cross-validation set (test set) have dementia (CDR>0), and if they do, the severity level of dementia (CDR values of 0.5, 1, and 2). The problem will be formulated both as a binary classification problem (CDR=0, and CDR>0), and multiclass classification problem (CDR values in the dataset: 0, 0.5, 1, and 2). In the binary classification formulation, the CDR>0 the values in the sliced dataset will be relabeled as CDR=11.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Classification Accuracy will be used as the primary metric. The results from the best model (one that provides the highest accuracy) will be reported along with those from the other models.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* About 80% of the data in the dataset will be used for training the models. About 20% of data will used prediction of the CDR label for the k-fold cross-validation with k=10. Sensitivity studies with proportion other than 80:20, e.g. 70:30, will be used to test sensitivity of this split on the accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* The base case will uses a dataset that combines the cross-sectional and the longitudinal MRI datasets.This has the benefit of having a larger dataset. The cross-sectional and the longitudinal datasets will also be trained/cross-validated separately, and classification accuracy will be reported.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data cleaning (e.g. removal of NaN values), dat exploration, data preparation, data visualization, and data preprocessing will be described, as needed, and the impact of the latter on prediction accuracy will be discussed."

    "\"Results During 10 years of follow-up, there were 119 confirmed cases of dementia, 84 of which were Alzheimer’s disease. The conventional risk model incorporated age, sex, education, cognition, physical function, lifestyle (smoking, alcohol use), health (cardiovascular disease, diabetes, systolic blood pressure), and the apolipoprotein genotype (C statistic for discrimination performance was 0.77, 95% confidence interval 0.71 to 0.82). No significant differences were observed in the discrimination performance of the conventional risk model compared with models incorporating data from MRI including white matter lesion volume (C statistic 0.77, 95% confidence interval 0.72 to 0.82; P=0.48 for difference of C statistics), brain volume (0.77, 0.72 to 0.82; P=0.60), hippocampal volume (0.79, 0.74 to 0.84; P=0.07), or all three variables combined (0.79, 0.75 to 0.84; P=0.05). Inclusion of hippocampal volume or all three MRI variables combined in the conventional model did, however, lead to significant improvement in reclassification measured by using the integrated discrimination improvement index (P=0.03 and P=0.04) and showed increased net benefit in decision curve analysis. Similar results were observed when the outcome was restricted to Alzheimer’s disease.\"\n",

    "\"Once the presence of dementia has been established, the role of imaging in the diagnosis of dementia subtypes is very much a function of the clinical diagnosis. The accuracy of the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is quite good. Pathological AD has a prevalence of about 70% (range 50% to above 80% depending upon whether the AD occurs in isolation or with other entities) among all dementias (see evidence Table 1 in reference 1 ); thus, even clinicians with limited neurological expertise should have a diagnostic accuracy, for AD at least, at about that level. A review of 13 published studies gave average values for sensitivity and specificity of the clinical diagnosis of AD of 81% and 70%, respectively(1). The overall accuracy of the clinical diagnosis of AD versus not-AD compared with the neuropathological standard based on those values for prevalence, sensitivity, and specificity, is 78%. \"\n",
